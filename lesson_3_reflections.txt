When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when doing project with other people, or to get contribution as an open source project.
    or to keep my project on the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because we might not want to pull some changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks: clone other people's repository to my github.
    clones: clone repository from github to local machine.
    branches: make a copy of my existing project. It's a kind of backup.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    we could see differences and choose to whether merge or not.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    since I have never used other ways, I can't think of any other method than Git and GitHub.
    but I think using Git and GitHub is very useful and convenient. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    make changes in branch: it's good way to collaborate with other people, and it assures not to break master.
    make change in master: it's ok if you are not going to collaborate with others. It might be simpler.
